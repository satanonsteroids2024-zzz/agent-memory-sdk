# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (v0.2 performance & semantic search batch)
- **SQLite FTS5 keyword index** with built-in BM25 ranking: keyword search no
  longer loads up to 10k rows and rebuilds a Python BM25 index per query
  (~12ms resolve at 5,000 memories, previously ~1s). Existing databases are
  backfilled automatically on first open.
- **Optional vector search on the default backend** via the `semantic` extra
  (`pip install agent-memory-sdk[semantic]`): sqlite-vec + fastembed (ONNX
  MiniLM, no torch). Auto-detected; `Memory(enable_embeddings=True)` to force.
  Handles paraphrases with zero shared words.
- **SQL-aggregate `stats()` and `cleanup()`** — no more silent 10k row cap;
  cleanup also removes FTS/vector index rows.
- `requires_verification=True` memories now always VERIFY (previously a high
  score replayed them silently, defeating the flag).
- `enable_verify=False` now degrades would-be VERIFY decisions to RESTORE
  instead of NONE.
- `decision_traps.json` eval dataset: 13 adversarial cases including
  shared-word traps; eval accepts VERIFY where RESTORE is expected (both
  surface the memory; verify is more cautious).
- Test suites: MCP reply contract over bulk data (`tests/test_mcp_server.py`),
  scale/latency regression tests (`tests/test_scale.py`), semantic backend
  tests (`tests/test_semantic_sqlite.py`). 119 tests total.
- `mcp_server.reset_memory()` and lazy env reads for testability.
- CONTRIBUTING.md with good-first-issues; docs/why-decision-layer.md.
- README demo GIF (regenerate via `docs/assets/record-demo.sh`).
- MCP Registry manifest (`server.json`, validated against the 2025-09-29
  schema) plus an `agent-memory-sdk` console-script alias so
  `uvx agent-memory-sdk` launches the MCP server; `mcp-name` ownership
  marker in the README. See docs/launch-checklist.md.

### Changed (v0.2 batch)
- `consolidate()` now issues one search per entry instead of one per pair
  (was O(N²) searches).
- Benchmark no longer invents an 800ms "no-memory baseline"; the comparison
  section only appears against a user-supplied `--baseline-ms`, labeled as
  such. docs/benchmarks.md publishes only reproducible numbers.
- SQLite `store()` uses an UPSERT (stable rowids for the FTS/vector indexes).
- CI: `actions/checkout`, mypy enforced (no `|| true`), ruff on all packages,
  a dedicated semantic-extras job, and an eval job. mypy is clean across the
  codebase.

### Fixed
- **Critical scoring bug**: the top BM25 hit was always normalized to a perfect 1.0,
  so any query sharing a single word with a stored memory replayed that memory's
  answer verbatim at confidence 1.0. Keyword scores are now scaled by query-term
  coverage, so weak overlaps score low and unrelated queries return `NONE`.
- **Decision score floor removed**: thresholds previously used
  `max(policy_score, raw_semantic)`, so confidence, recency, and usage could never
  lower a decision below the raw retrieval score (a confidence-0.1 memory still
  replayed). Low-confidence memories now RESTORE as context instead of replaying.
- Replaying a memory no longer resets its `updated_at`, so frequently-replayed
  stale facts correctly age into VERIFY instead of looking perpetually fresh.
- ChromaDB backend now stores the query in metadata; multiline queries are no
  longer corrupted on read-back.
- README repo links pointed at the old `agent-memory` repository name.
- **MCP server crashed on fresh installs**: `mcp>=1.0.0` resolves to mcp 2.x,
  which renamed `FastMCP` to `MCPServer`. The server now imports either API.

### Added
- Query-term coverage scoring with a shared stop-word list and plural folding
- SQLite WAL mode + 30s busy timeout for concurrent access (MCP server + CLI + app
  sharing one database file)
- `ttl` parameter on the MCP `remember_memory` tool
- Regression tests for decision quality (`tests/test_decision_quality.py`)
- PyPI metadata: authors, keywords, classifiers, project URLs

### Changed
- Hybrid scoring now lets the stronger retrieval channel (semantic or keyword)
  dominate, improving paraphrase handling on the ChromaDB backend
- README documents backend trade-offs honestly: the default `sqlite` backend is
  lexical-only; use `chromadb` for semantic paraphrase matching

### Added (pre-existing unreleased items)
- SQLite backend (`SqliteMemoryStore`) as default lightweight storage
- Async API support (`aremember`, `aresolve`, `alist`, `aget`, `aforget`, `aarchive`, `acleanup`, `astats`, `aconsolidate`)
- Backend selection via `backend` parameter in `Memory` constructor (`"chromadb"` or `"sqlite"`)
- Comprehensive test coverage for both ChromaDB and SQLite backends
- Package distribution configuration (wheel, sdist)
- Docker support with both backends

### Changed
- **Default backend changed from ChromaDB to SQLite** for lightweight deployments
- Version bumped to `0.1.0-alpha` (was incorrectly `0.3.0` in code/docs)
- Updated roadmap to reflect completed features

### Fixed
- Version inconsistency across `pyproject.toml`, `agent_memory/__init__.py`, and `README.md`
- Clean code principles and SOLID OOP compliance across all modules

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-06-28
